        <h5><b>Designing Nigeria's national flag:</b></h5>
        <p><text>In 1958, Nigeria started working towards becoming part of the big boys. We were ready to be an independent country, which led to the creation of a national planning committee. The national planning committee held a competition to select the national flag, with the winner chosen by popular vote. 
        There were about 3000 submissions, but in the end, Taiwo Akinkunmiâ€™s design ultimately won. But did you know that the committee altered Taiwoâ€™s original flag design? His original concept for the flag included a red burning sun in the middle of the white vertical stripe, with two green bands on both sides. 
        The sun symbolised divine protection and guidance, the green represents our natural wealth, and the white signifies peace. 
        However, due to Nigeriaâ€™s diversity, the committee decided itâ€™d be better to have a relatively simple flag design. And on October 1, 1960, our new National flag was officially adopted and flown publicly for the first time.</text></p></div>
